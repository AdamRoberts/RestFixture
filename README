RestFixture: A FitNesse fixture for testing REST services
=========================================================

The RestFixture is a FitNesse (http://fitnesse.org)  fixture that allows
developers and/or product owners to write test fixtures for REST services
with simplicity in mind. The idea is to write tests that are self
documenting and easy to write and read, without the need to write Java code.

The fixture allows test writers to express tests as actions (any of the
allowed HTTP methods) to operate on resource URIs and express expectations on
the content of the return code, headers and body. All without writing one
single line of Java code.

And it also works as a living/executable documentation of the API.

Build
-----
To build RestFixture edit the build.properties and set the values of the
properties to reflect your environment.
Use
> ant
or
> ant full
to run the defaul target (this will build the Rest Fixture, start a local instance
of FitNesse on port 7070 and run the fitnesse tests in fitdocs. If it all succeedes
a build of the RestFixture is available in dist/ alongside with the latest documentation

To build and run unit tests run
> and test


Note on dependencies
--------------------
RestFixture distribution contains the file etc/restfixture/sequence.pic
part of UMLGraph (http://www.umlgraph.org), distributed under BSD license (see
etc/restfixture/BSDLICENSE)

Install
-------

To use the RestFixture, simply add RestFixture-<ver>.jar to your FitNesse tests classpath,
alongside its dependencies. Dependencies are bundled in the RestFixture-<ver>.zip, or
in the lib/ directory.

For example,

!*****> Classpath Settings
!path @FITNESSE_TEST_ROOT@/lib/*
!path @FITNESSE_TEST_ROOT@/lib/log4j.xml
!path @FITNESSE_HOME@/fitnesse.jar
****!

@FITNESSE_TEST_ROOT@/lib is where the jars are
 @FITNESSE_HOME@ is where fitnesse.jar is

 Any page which is child of the content.txt page where the !path is defined will be able to
 use the Rest Fixture (see fitdocs/ for a fully working example)
