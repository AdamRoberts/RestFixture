Patched version of crap4j v1.1.6 with 

- a fix for Windows platforms for an issue in the Ant task that prevents id of crap4j home

  With this fix, crap4j_home is passed to the ant task

  <taskdef name="crap4j" classname="org.crap4j.anttask.Crap4jAntTask">
   ...
  </taskdef>

  <crap4j crap4jhome="${crap4j.home}" ...>
   ...
  </crap4j>

- updated version of ant (1.8.2)

  the bundled version is not compatible with the crap4j_build.xml generated (error on BatchesTask not supporting file attribute)
